        My name is Michael Lee Trcka and I’m in training to be a full stack web developer. I’m currently learning both front and back end programming. The reason I want to program is because programming is an ever-changing field and it always has new and unique problems to be solved. I like how programming is so customizable and flexible, but as I learn it I’m finding out that is also one of that parts that makes programming a pain in the ass. I plan to immerse myself like going to meet ups and I want to build projects that challenge what I know. I know that repetition and practice are the keys to success in this field and I plan to follow them to where I want to go. I want to help make the internet beautiful.</p>
